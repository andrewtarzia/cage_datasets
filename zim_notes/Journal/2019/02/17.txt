====== Sunday 17 Feb 2019 ======

* unclear things:
	* query 4:
		* QA in main figure in paper == QA = O, N, P, C, B, S
		* QA im Figure S17 (query 4) == QA = N, C — using this in previous test
	* query 7:
		* QA in main figure in paper == QA = O, N, P, C, B, S
		* QA im Figure S22 (query 7) == QA = N, O — using this in previous test
* changes compared to [[Journal:2019:02:14|14/02/19]]:
	* added a new query that searches for 'catena-', 'catena(', 'catena[',  in the name item
		* this actually caused problems — just added 'catena' as name search (instead of text search as in [[Journal:2019:02:14|14/02/19]])
	* unmerge all merged queries
* make sure all examples in the supp info show up or don't show up:
	* criterion2:
		* ZOMSAV shows up when it shouldn't
			* how to force rings to have at least one carbon atom?
			* this structure is in the MOF dataset? when it should not be?
				* emailing them — done
	* criterion 1:
		* ECUHOB shows up when it shouldn't because QA == QB in criteria 1?
			* why was this not ignored?
				* didnt show up in q1a and q1b searches only
				* shows up in q2a search — therefore need to implement that one element in the ring must be a C?
			* Doesnt show up in MOF subset
