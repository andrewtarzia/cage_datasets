====== disorder+solvent ======
Created Thursday 14 February 2019

* Moghadam2017:
	* they create two lists (all MOFs and then nondisordered MOFs) but they do not specify exactly how they did this without considering the disorder of the solvent in their classifier.
* search for 'Squeeze/PLATON' in 'Disorder' section?
* define reference solvent/ion structures and upon finding them, replace disordered molecules with clean reference states that pass the atom typer (for UFF) without ambiguity
	* idea from Matt Addicoat on [[Journal:2019:02:18|18/02/19]]
