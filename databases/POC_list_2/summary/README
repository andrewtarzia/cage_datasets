== Method == 
1) searched the CSD using the CSD API and the script get_from_author.py:
    - search by author last name
    - exclude:
        - if 'catena' in entry.chemical_name or entry.chemical_name is None
        - if entry.is_polymeric is True
        - if entry.is_powder_study is True
        - if entry.is_organometallic is True (ORGANIC CAGES ONLY) (NOTE THAT THE CSD IS NOT PERFECT AT GETTING THIS VALUE RIGHT - Mg is not considered metallic?)
    - Note: this process entriely depends on the data available in the CSD you are searching.
        - i.e. HIWHOM and VOFROZ do not have 3d_structures in the CSD on my local machine and therefore get skipped.
    --> 67721 cifs found from 35 authors (FILL IN NO)
    --> REFCODEs in DB.gcd

2) Using 'REFCODEs_to_CIFs.py' and CSD API. [IN FUTURE, REPLACE WITH: REFCODEs_to_PDBs.py]
    - get CIFs in DB DIR from REFCODEs in DB.gcd
    - save REFCODEs of entries with entry.has_3d_structure is False to misssing_struct.gcd
        - check for possible cross references to old REFCODEs
        - save cross references to cross_refs.csv
    --> structures missing: 1677 of 67721
    --> cross refs used: 1889 of 67721

3) Sort structures based on the presence of a porous molecule in the CIF
    - too many structures to visualize manually
    - run sort_structures.py
        - checks if a CIF contains at least one molecule (by pywindow modularization) with
        a pore_diameter_opt > some tolerance (set to 0.25 angstrom)
        - deletes all CIFs collected in step 2 that fail this test        
        - outputs the results to sorting.csv:
            - cif with Y if deleted, N if not deleted (i.e. has porous molecule), M if
            deleted because CIF was missing OR if ASE failed to load CIF.
        - if a structure fails with a Memory error, it suggests the structure is very
        disordered, and they are moved to ./memory/
        - if 'Unknown' in .cif --> remove structure as it will fail.
    - THIS METHODOLOGY WILL REMOVE STRUCTURES THAT ARE CAGE-LIKE BUT NONPOROUS

4) Check structures in ./memory/ for simple fixes
    - these structures are likely broken due to disorder
    - structures tested:
		* IYEMAC_extracted.cif — is cage — keep
		* NEDBUW_extracted.cif — is cage — do not keep because is_organometallic fails    
        * NEXLAD_extracted.cif - nonporous -  do not keep
		* PAWSEO_extracted.cif — is porous — keep (has Rb — suggesting it shouldn't have passed to this step?)
		* QEFMUM_extracted.cif — is porous — keep
		* TEKZER_extracted.cif — not porous — do not keep
		* WOSMUO02_extracted.cif — periodic/nonporous — do not keep
		* WOSMUO03_extracted.cif — periodic/nonporous — do not keep
		* WOSMUO04_extracted.cif — periodic/nonporous — do not keep
		* WOSMUO05_extracted.cif — periodic/nonporous — do not keep
		* ZODXEX_extracted.cif — nonporous — do not keep
    - by:
        - delete all atoms in CIF with '?'
            - note that if PDBs are used throughout, then this will need to be done manually in a structure modification software.
        - if this fails, then we do not keep that structure because any other changes require manual chemical modifications:
            - failed for PAWSEO_extracted.cif and QEFMUM_extracted.cif
        - copy .cif, .pdb and _rebuild.pdb from /memory/ to ../

5) Write post_pw.gcd using CIFs_to_GCD.py [IN FUTURE, REPLACE WITH: PDBs_to_GCD.py]
    - assumes that any remaining CIFs must be accepted
    - have 5907 CIFs at this stage (6623, 1414)

6) Run REFCODEs_to_PDBs.py on post_pw.gcd to get _extracted.pdb of all REFCODEs [Not necessary if using PDBs_to_GCD.py]
    - get PDBs from post_pw.gcd

7) Initial screen is done. Now run classify_structures.py to find cages, and output the porous molecules of those cages
    - check PDB for molecules that are cages by this definition:
        - pore_diameter_opt > 0.0 angstrom
        - no_windows >= 2  # masterlerz definition
    - output:
        - classified.csv:
            - refcode, molecule id, pore_diameter_opt, no_windows
        - save cage molecules of each PDB to PDBs

8) delete CIFs/PDBs in DIR that are not in classified.csv
    - any items in classified.csv with zeros in all columns (other than REFCODE) had their CIFs and PDBs removed.
    - 3813 _extracted.pdb remaining (XXXXX, 1130)
    - INAGUA and JAQBOT had memory issues, and were skipped.

9) Visualize the most porous molecule of each structure and manually filter for cage structures using ASE.
    - performed with script: viz_structures_ase.py (this could be made much more efficient in the future.)
    - this search is dependant on the usage of the DB. In this case, I have kept only cage-like structures.
        - which means I have removed '1D'-macrocylic structures (i.e. ACAVAE)
        - also removed spiral like structures
    - any structures that showed buggy behaviour in ASE (i.e. the window COMs had large values) were removed.
        - removed AKIFAB due to pore handling of connected rings in pywindow
    - kept CAHTEM, CAHTEMXX, CAHVAK, CAHVAKXX
        - pywindow did not handle guests well, which lead to a bug.
    - Ignored structures with multiple independant cavities in one discrete molecule
    - save REFCODEs in to_keep --> viz_select.gcd

10) Copy structures deemed to be cages into ./cage_subset/
    - for all REFCODEs in viz_select.gcd:
        - cp REFCODE* ./cage_subset/

11) Remove solvent using remove_solvent.py
    - defines a solvent molecule as pore_diam_opt < 0 or no_windows < 2

12) Fill in DB_sheet.ods
    Info to gather:
        - whether there is disorder in the cage (specifically not the solvent)
            - done visually
        - whether squeeze or mask has been used
            - written (with other info) to solvent_prop.csv using get_solvent_info.py and CSD Python API
        - whether there is solvent present
            - done using solv_pres.py (checks if _rebuild.pdb has more atoms than _nosolv.pdb)
            - output to solvent_pres.txt and added to DB_sheet.ods
        - classify into a structure type
            - done visually
    In this process:
        - deleted undesired structure types (sheet: deleted)
        - fixed bugs with structures that required manual solvent removal (noted in full_DB sheet):
            - move each lot of files for the following REFCODEs to /cage_subset/originals/
            - apply the following edits:
                - CAHTEM
                    - deleted all iodine atoms using ASE
                - CAHTEM01
